# Programming 2: Ally's Tutorial Questions

The best way to learn a programming language and the concepts that underlie the language's design is to do *lots*
of programming.

The aim of these tutorial questions is to give you the opportunity to write, inspect, debug and play with a bunch of reasonably small programs.  There are quite a lot of questions, they form part of the examinable material for the course, and thus I strongly encourage you to attempt *all* of them.

I also encourage you to explore your own variations of and extensions to the tutorial questions.  Think of extra features you could add to some
of the programs, and try to add them.

## When are these tutorials?

There aren't any.  I'm calling them "tutorial questions", but really the questions are for your own self-study.  I won't be running tutorial sessions during my part of the course; instead we will do lots of live coding in class.  While I might touch on a few of these questions, the vast majority of them won't be discussed.  Similarly, your programming tutor or undergraduate teaching assistant might choose to go over some of these questions during PPT sessions, but they are not part of the core material to be covered in PPT groups.

So, once again: do try out all the questions **in your own time** before the final test!

## When should I attempt each question?

The questions are presented in a reasonably logical order, but this order might not match exactly the order we cover material during the lectures.  I suggest that you try out each question as soon as you feel you've learned enough to have a stab at it.  I've indicated using links where there are dependencies between questions, and have tagged each question with one or more topic areas.

## Reporting errors

For everyone's benefit (including the benefit of future students), please email me ([afd](mailto:afd@ic.ac.uk)) if you find errors in these sheets or the sample solutions.

## If you get stuck

* Ask me for help after lectures and tutorials
* Attend the lab sessions and ask the lab helpers for advice
* Send me an email ([afd](mailto:afd@ic.ac.uk))

However, before you ask for help do make sure you have spent a significant
amount of time scratching your head and thinking about your problem, and looking for solutions in the lecture notes
and other available sources.  You will likely learn a lot by really trying to figure things out for yourself.
If you are still stuck after this then I, and the others involved in the course, will be very happy to help.

## Question labels, dependencies and tags

Each question is labelled with a 4-digit hex identifier, e.g. 98e3.

Some of the questions depend on other questions; I have indicated wherever this is the case, linking to the prerequisite question.

To help you decide how you should prioritise working through the questions, I have attached one or more tags to each question in the list below.  The tags are as follows:

* <span style="color:aqua">Recap</span>: the question serves to recap basic imperative concepts of Java: loops, recursion, variables, arrays and enumerations, or basic use of objects.


## The questions!

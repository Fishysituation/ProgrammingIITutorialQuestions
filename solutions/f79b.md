## Solution to [f79b](../questions/f79b): *Perfect palindromic cubes*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/questionf79b`

The solution involves a method:

```
static boolean isPalindrome(String s);
```

which determines whether the `String` parameter `s` is a palindrome.  The method is recursive.  As a base case, strings of length 0 and 1 are (trivially) palindromes; we use the method `length()` of `String` to determine this.
For a string of greater length, we check whether its first and last characters are the same.  This is achieved using the `charAt(int i)` method,
which returns the character at position `i` of the string.

Armed with `isPalindrome`, we enumerate the first 2000 cubes using a `for` loop.  For each cube, we turn it into a string using
`String.valueOf`, and test the resulting string using `isPalindrome`.
